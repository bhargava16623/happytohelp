#Launch steps:

##Prerequisites:

Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. You can verify their installation by running node -v and npm -v (or yarn -v) in your terminal. Steps:

->Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com//.git Replace with your GitHub username and with the name of your React app repository.

->Navigate to the project directory:

cd

->Install dependencies:

npm install (If you use yarn, replace npm install with yarn install)

This command will download all the necessary libraries and dependencies your React app requires to function.

->Start the development server:

npm start (If you use yarn, replace npm start with yarn start)

This command will start a development server, usually on http://localhost:3000 by default. You can then open your web browser and visit this address to see your React app running live.
